	Sadly, I don't have enough time to continue developing this framework.
	Some components would have to be completelly rewritten, to meet my current needs.
	Hovever, if you want, you can still use it for your own project!
	Every component should work fine, since LUI-3 is used on websites that are in production

	<strong>You can find all LUI-3 components on Gitlab:</strong>
