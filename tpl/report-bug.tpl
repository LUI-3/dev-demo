<h1>Report bug</h1>

<h2>Framework-wide bug</h2>

<p>
	Bugs that are happening across whole framework should be reported in Base component <a href="//github.com/LUI-3/base/issues" target="_blank">issues</a> and please add "[fw-wide]" to the issue title.
</p>

<h2>Cross-component bug</h2>

<p>
	If you find same bug happening to lets say Pagebars component and Buttons, report them in both repositores and add reference between them (simply add link to other issue and github should handle the rest)
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Please add much info as possible into your reports, so bugs can be fixed asap!</strong>
