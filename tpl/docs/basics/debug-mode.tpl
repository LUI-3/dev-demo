<h1>Debug Mode</h1>

<p>
	Currently Debug Mode is supported only for debugging GRID column sizes in each breakpoint. When you enable it, you will may see something like <code>col-xs-12</code> or <code>col-xs-5</code> 
	in each column you used, depending on column settings and your browser window size/resolution.
</p>

<p>
	In future versions Debug Mode will be used to troubleshoot way more parts of framework. In current state it can be used to see 
	which column is displayed on your mobile devices, which dont have debug console in their browsers.
